In computer programming,  assembly language (alternatively assembler language or symbolic machine code), often referred to simply as assembly and commonly abbreviated as ASM or asm, is any low-level programming language with a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions. Assembly language usually has one statement per machine instruction (1:1), but  constants, comments, assembler directives, symbolic labels of, e.g., memory locations, registers, and macros are generally also supported.
