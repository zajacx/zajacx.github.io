                <h2 class="grid justify-center text-2xl mb-4"><strong>About</strong></h2>
                
                <p class="mt-2 mb-10 text-justify"><strong>Jacob Collier</strong> is an English singer,
                    songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, producer and educator. His music incorporates
                    a combination of jazz and elements from other musical genres, and often features
                    extensive use of reharmonisations and close harmony. He is known for his energetic
                    live performances, in which he often conducts the audience to sing harmony or play
                    percussion parts. Collier demonstrates his harmonic expertise in lectures and
                    master classes, particularly with his detailed analyses of songs like Stevie
                    Wonder's "Sir Duke" and his own music.</p>
                
                    <p class="mt-2 mb-10 text-justify">In 2013, his split-screen video covers of popular songs, such as Stevie Wonder's
                    "Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing", began to go viral on YouTube. In 2014, Collier
                    signed with Quincy Jones's management company and began working on his one-man,
                    audio-visual live performance vehicle, designed and built at the MIT Media Lab by
                    Ben Bloomberg. In 2016, Collier released his debut album, In My Room, which he
                    recorded, arranged, performed and produced himself in the back room of his family
                    home in Finchley, North London. In 2017, Collier was awarded Grammy Awards for
                    his arrangements of "Flintstones" and "You and I". In 2018, Collier began working
                    on <b>Djesse</b>, a four-volume, 50-song album featuring more than two dozen artists
                    and ensembles. The first volume, which featured the Metropole Orkest, Djesse Vol. 1,
                    was released in December 2018. The second, Djesse Vol. 2, used more acoustic
                    instrumentation and was released in July 2019.</p>
                
                    <p class="mt-2 mb-10 text-justify">In 2020, Collier won Grammy Awards for his arrangements of "All
                    Night Long (All Night)" from Djesse Vol. 1 and "Moon River" from Djesse Vol. 2. In
                    2021, he won a Grammy Award for "He Won't Hold You" from the third volume, Djesse Vol. 3.
                    Collier is the first British artist to receive a Grammy Award for each of his first four
                    albums.</p>
